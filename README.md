# Sora2Web (Official) 🎥

Welcome to the official community repo for **[sora2web.net](https://sora2web.net)**.

## What is this?

We realized that accessing top-tier AI video models like OpenAI's Sora 2 is still a pain. You either have to wait on a waitlist, manage complex developer accounts, or deal with regional restrictions.

**Sora2Web solves that.**

We built a streamlined web interface that hooks directly into the official APIs of the best video models out there. We handle the heavy lifting, the API keys, and the backend infrastructure. You just type a prompt and get a video.

## Supported Models 🚀

We are essentially a "Super Wrapper." Instead of paying for 5 different subscriptions, you can access all these engines from one dashboard:

* **Sora 2 (OpenAI)** - *Yes, the real one.*
* **Veo3**
* **Kling AI**
* **Wan**
* **Nano Banana**
* *(More models are added weekly as soon as their APIs go live)*

## Why this repo?

Since we are a web-based tool, you don't need to install anything.

We created this GitHub repository to:
1.  **Track Bugs:** Found a glitch on the site? Open an Issue here.
2.  **Feature Requests:** Want us to add a new model (like Runway or Pika)? Let us know.
3.  **Transparency:** Show that we are real humans building a real product.

## How it works (Under the hood)

For the curious nerds: We act as a proxy layer. When you hit generate on our site, we route your request through our optimized backend directly to the respective official provider (e.g., OpenAI or Google). We don't train the models; we just make them accessible to everyone, instantly.

## Stay Updated

We drop updates and free credit codes on X quite often. If you have questions or just want to see cool demos:
